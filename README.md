# IngrediGenius: Recipe Generator (Ongoing Project)

IngrediGenius is an ongoing Android app project designed to help users generate recipes based on the ingredients they have and the time available. Users can input available ingredients, and the app will suggest recipe ideas, allowing for efficient meal planning and cooking.

The app leverages a large local dataset, ensuring fast and reliable recipe suggestions without the need for an internet connection. Built using Android Studio, Java, Kotlin, and XML, IngrediGenius is being developed to make meal preparation easier and more convenient for home cooks.
